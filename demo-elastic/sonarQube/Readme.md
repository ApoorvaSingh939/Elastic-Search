# SonarQube Analysis Report

## Summary

This repository has undergone a SonarQube analysis to assess code quality and identify areas for improvement. Below is a summary of the findings before and after implementing the required changes:

### Before Changes

- **Security Hotspots:** 1 found
- **Technical Debt:** 1 hour 42 minutes
- **Code Smells:** 15 detected

### After Changes

- **Security Hotspots:** 0
- **Technical Debt:** 0 hours 0 minutes
- **Code Smells:** 0

## Analysis Details

### Security Hotspots

Before: 
- Used .printStackTrace() in a try-catch block, potentially exposing sensitive information.

After:
- Replaced .printStackTrace() with appropriate logging (e.g., log.error).

### Code Smells

Before:
1. Commented-out dependencies in properties file.
2. Duplicate logging of header and body.

Changes made:
1. Removed commented-out dependencies.
2. Created a logging route (loggingRoute) to handle header and body logging in a single place.
3. Replaced direct string calls with defined string variables(String loggingRoute="direct:loggingCurrentheaderandbody").

## Conclusion

After addressing the identified issues, the codebase is now free from security hotspots, technical debt, and code smells, leading to improved code quality and maintainability.
